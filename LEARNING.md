# SQL Learning Notes 

[ Terjemahkan ke Bahasa Indonesia](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&tl=id&u=https://github.com/anovpad-code/SQL/blob/main/LEARNING.md)

Today I learned the fundamental building blocks of Database Management:

* **`CREATE TABLE`**: Used to create a new table in the database where data can be stored.
* **`INSERT INTO`**: Used to add new data (records) into an existing table.
* **`SELECT`**: Used to fetch or retrieve specific data from the database.

### Goal
My goal is to understand how data is structured and manipulated efficiently using Structured Query Language.
